# Initial foray (Saturday, 26 January 2019, 13:24PM)

At least on first analysis this game ticks a couple of boxes for me in terms of continuing interests for exploration when I'm making these games of mine...

__Repetition and variation__

It's another step in the series of _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment_ games, each of which (at least after the first, or perhaps including it) has been about re-exploring the core ideas involved with some newly introduced constraint/perspective. So this game is naturally in conversation with all the rest as a way of thinking about what remaking the "same" game over and over again is like. It's part of the project that includes PONGS and BREAKSOUT in that way, also things like SNAKISMS and Sibilant Snakelikes too. The value in this case is the contribution to a larger exploration of what we can say about the nature of games by repeating ourselves with variation, another kind of Exercises in Style thing that reveals features of the medium/platform/technology/rules/design/etc. through (semi?)formal experimentation.

__Translation__

The game is another instance of translation from one medium/platform/form to another. In this case it's closest to the translation approach between _v r 1_ and _b r 1_, it's a translation between platforms while keeping the core design principles/underlying concepts stable. In this case it's a translation between a Phaser-based, retro-gaming experience of the punishments to a UI-oriented, jQuery-based version of the same experiences. As such it's about revealing features of the underlying technology and form, about looking at how design reacts to its materials. How do you make a chair out of wood? What about out of concrete? Right?

__User interface and expression__

The game is part of the trajectory of the _It is as if..._ games, though perhaps more in keeping with _It is as if you were playing chess_ in that it's not at attempt at speculative design, but more specifically about how the interface can express different kinds of experiences/performances. I guess _It is as if you were making love_ fits this bill too - an unfamiliar/"wrong/" experience presented in the language of UI. So this game is about the ability of interface elements to express the concepts drawn from Greek mythology: eternity, suffering. And perhaps Camus's happy Sisyphus for all we know.
