# Sisyphus

- ~~Get a dialog box with a slider in it~~
- ~~__LOOKS TOO WEIRD__ Try out the slider at a diagonal~~
- ~~Get a confirmation button going~~
- ~~Make the slider slide (lerp) back down when you release it~~
- ~~Make sure the instruction is clear~~
- ~~__DID IT IN CSS__ Look into the issue of clicking on a slider pip - basically just want to disable them~~
- ~~No closing the dialog ever~~
- ~~Have an icon on the desktop to launch the app~~

- Sound

# Danaids

- ~~Dialog box with a file and a folder~~
- ~~Set the file to revert when you drag it anywhere~~
- ~~Icon on the desktop~~
- ~~__NO, THE INSTRUCTION IS ALWAYS SO SIMPLE THAT IT CAN REMAIN PRESENT__ Should these things have an initial instruction in a dialog and thereafter none except for a "Help" button?~~
- ~~__NO, THE POINT ISN'T TO CONTROVERT THE BASICS OF USABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY__ Or even no explanation at all so you have to get Help? (May be too obtuse?)~~
- ~~Have the folder highlight to at least show you're "succeeding in targeting it"?~~
- ~~__IT REALLY WAS, BUT I FIXED IT WITH RADIO BUTTONS__ Consider how this one might be a touch underdone right now~~
- ~~Implement as radio buttons "empty" and "full" so when you select full you can submit, but the option switches back to "empty" when you try. Hilarious.~~

- Sound

# Tantalus

- ~~Dialog box with a drop down with both options greyed out~~
- ~~Submit button that won't work if you haven't selected anything (maybe an error message?)~~
- ~~__THE SELECT MENU IS PRETTY PERFECT__ Also consider trying: checkboxes, radio buttons, disabled buttons at the bottom? All possible. Maybe make all of them launch at once as a way to just test which feels best?~~
- ~~Icon etc. for launching~~

- Sound

# Zeno

- ~~__NOT NEEDED BECAUSE THE WIZARD VERSION IS GREAT__ Look into recursive forms of the accordion~~
- ~~__NOT NEEDED BECAUSE THE WIZARD VERSION IS GREAT__ Look into recursive forms of the drop-down~~
- ~~Look into recursion via dialog boxes - an endless process - oh shit, like a series of steps! (Step 1 of 2, Step 1.5 of 2, Step 1.75 of 2!!!! Fuuuuuck, that's pretty good. Much easier to represent man.)~~
- ~~Implement "wizard version" with steps~~

- Look at restrictions on the precision of the float to make sure behaviour works if people really go for it
- Text generation (or something) for each step? It's a bit spare?
- Sound

# Prometheus

- ~~Get the basic liver progress bar in a dialog~~
- ~~Peck dialog appears on top (maybe random location on screen for desktop?) and has a countdown timer for you to cancel it within (think about the language here as it's pretty awkward?)~~
- ~~__IT DOES__ Keep thinking about whether this one really works~~

- Language pass of course
- Sound
- Dialog positions?

# Mobile

- Mostly rely on the work done for Love and focusing on UI that is narrow. Limit it to one app at a time, possibly by faking a home screen instead of a desktop. This would mean needing to reload the page since you won't be able to exit any of these games. More thought probably required.
