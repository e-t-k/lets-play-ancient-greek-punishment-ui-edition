# Sisyphus

- ~~Get a dialog box with a slider in it~~
- ~~__LOOKS TOO WEIRD__ Try out the slider at a diagonal~~
- ~~Get a confirmation button going~~
- ~~Make the slider slide (lerp) back down when you release it~~
- ~~Make sure the instruction is clear~~
- ~~__DID IT IN CSS__ Look into the issue of clicking on a slider pip - basically just want to disable them~~
- ~~No closing the dialog ever~~

- Have an icon on the desktop to launch the app

# Danaids

- Dialog box with a file and a folder
- Set the file to revert when you drag it anywhere
- Have the folder highlight to at least show you're "succeeding in targeting it"
- Icon on the desktop
- Should these things have an initial instruction in a dialog and thereafter none except for a "Help" button?
- Or even no explanation at all so you have to get Help? (May be too obtuse?)

# Tantalus

- Dialog box with a drop down with both options greyed out
- Submit button that won't work if you haven't selected anything (maybe an error message?)
- Also consider trying: checkboxes, radio buttons, disabled buttons at the bottom? All possible. Maybe make all of them launch at once as a way to just test which feels best?

# Zeno

- Look into recursive forms of the accordion
- Look into recursive forms of the drop-down
- Look into recursion via dialog boxes - an endless process - oh shit, like a series of steps! (Step 1 of 2, Step 1.5 of 2, Step 1.75 of 2!!!! Fuuuuuck, that's pretty good. Much easier to represent man.)

# Prometheus

- Get the basic liver progress bar in a dialog
- Peck dialog appears on top (maybe random location on screen for desktop?) and has a countdown timer for you to cancel it within (think about the language here as it's pretty awkward?)
- Keep thinking about whether this one really works

# Mobile

- Mostly rely on the work done for Love and focusing on UI that is narrow. Limit it to one app at a time, possibly by faking a home screen instead of a desktop. This would mean needing to reload the page since you won't be able to exit any of these games. More thought probably required.
